Bengaluru House Prices Prediction - Full Stack Flask Application
This project demonstrates a full-stack application using Flask for predicting house prices in Bengaluru based on features such as location, size (in square feet), number of bathrooms, and number of bedrooms (BHK). The application uses machine learning models to predict the price of a house using a trained linear regression model.

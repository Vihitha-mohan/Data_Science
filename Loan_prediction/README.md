Loan Prediction uding SVM
This repository demonstrates how to use the famous Iris dataset for classification with K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) using the scikit-learn library.


Requirements
------------------
Python libraries:

scikit-learn
sklearn
pandas
seaborn


pip install scikit-learn numpy matplotlib

Steps Overview:
------------------
1. Load the Iris Dataset
2. Split the Data into training and testing sets
3. Train a SVM on the training data
4. Evaluate the Model using accuracy on the testing set
5. Make Predictions on unseen data
